## Overview
### Description
Allows language-learners to match with each other based on what language they are learning. The goal is for each user to match with someone that speaks the langauge they are trying to learn and who is trying to learn the language that you (the user) is learning. This would allow both users to speak to each other in their target lanaguage. The app would allow the user to select their desired language and then show suggestions based on those that speak that language and are nearby, but would also allow the user to expand their radius. Each user would have a profile where they can list their interests. User's could also make posts to their profile, which others can tap to translate to their langauge. Additional: in addition to recommending nearby people, tehy would also allow for a matching feature like Tinder's to make sure that both would be a good match for each other. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Education / Social
- **Mobile:** Users would be able to look at a map to see which users are nearby, make video calls with each other, and send voice memos, which would require access to location, camera and microphone. The accessibility of a mobile app allowing you to send messages and view on-the-go also makes it more uniquely mobile. 
- **Story:** This app's value comes from being able to connect language-learners with each other. In addition, while many other language-learning platforms teach vocabulary, they don't have a lot of features to practice pronunciation and speaking it, and sometimes the vocabulary of native speakers is different from what you are learning or it may be more challenging to understand a native speaker speaking, so this would be a great place to practice and meet others. 
- **Market:** My audience is language-leaners who want to gain practice in speaking the language that they are learning. This wouold prbably be a very niche group of people. While other language-learning apps have a large number of users, I feel like this app would not be the most beginner-friendly app since you would need too have some knowledge of the lnaguage you are trying to learn in order to communicate with others, or otherwise you wouldn't be getting much benefit from the app. 
- **Habit:** Ideally, the user would use this app daily, for at least 30 minutes. There would be daily or weekly reminders set up by the user to remind the user to open the app. In order for users to build connections with each other and to retain what they are learning, it'd be best for them to build a habit of practicing daily or weekly. 
- **Scope:** It will be challenging to implement some of the features sch as translation, but a very simple app that allows for matching, posting, and messaging is attainable in the given timeframe.
